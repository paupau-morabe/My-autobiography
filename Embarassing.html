	<p style="font-family:Times New Roman"><p style="font-size:20px"> My most embarrassing experience is still fresh in my mind. I've spent my entire life trying to put this moment behind me, but it just won't go away. When I recall that day, I can't help but laugh. I experienced this awkward situation in elementary school. Because it was a Scouting Day, everyone was urged to take part in the activities. Yes, I did sign up, but the moment the race started, I stumbled and fell to the ground. I immediately started crying because everyone was gazing at me.</p>
